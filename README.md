# 🌿 Asthma Weed Detection & Classification (Streamlit App)

This project uses a **ResNet-50 deep learning model** trained with PyTorch to detect and classify **asthma weed (Euphorbia hirta)** in agricultural images.  
It helps estimate **weed presence and density per square meter**, supporting early detection and better farm management.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 **ResNet-50 Transfer Learning** for image classification (asthmaweed vs non_asthmaweed)
- 🧩 **Patch-based classification** to estimate weed density
- 📊 **Interactive visualization** of patch predictions
- 📁 **Report generation** with summary statistics (weed percentage, confidence, density)
- 🖼️ **Streamlit web interface** for real-time image analysis
